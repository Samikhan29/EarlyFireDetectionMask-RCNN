# **Project Title: Image Segmentation using Mask R-CNN with Tensorflow**


### **Project Overview:**
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for early fire detection that can accurately identify, localize, and segment fire instances in images. Early fire detection is crucial to prevent damage to life and property, and a robust fire detection system can play a significant role in saving lives and reducing the impact of fires.

### **Image Localization and Segmentation:**
Image localization and segmentation are two important tasks in computer vision. Image localization refers to the process of finding the location of an object of interest in an image, while image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments, where each segment corresponds to a different object or background. These two tasks are crucial in detecting and classifying objects in an image.

### **Mask R-CNN:**
Mask R-CNN (Regional Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning architecture that is specifically designed for object detection and instance segmentation. It extends the Faster R-CNN architecture by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. The network uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the image and uses a region proposal network (RPN) to propose regions that are likely to contain an object. The mask branch of the network then outputs a binary mask for each instance of the object, allowing for precise instance-level segmentation.

In this project, the Mask R-CNN architecture will be trained on a dataset of fire images, and the network will be evaluated on new images to assess its performance in detecting and localizing fire instances. The final output of the network will be a set of bounding boxes around fire instances, along with a binary mask for each instance, providing a precise representation of the location and extent of fire in the image.
